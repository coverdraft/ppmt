Block Lifecycle Metadata - The V3 Innovation

Each Trie node carries 12 metadata fields that encode:
- When to enter (trigger_candle)
- How long the pattern should last (remaining_candles)
- Expected move and risk parameters
- Forward continuation and backward context
- Historical statistics

This metadata makes PPMT autonomous — all entry/exit/SL/TP decisions
emerge directly from the Trie without external indicators.
